A brief description of the role goes here.

Requirements
------------
Internet Access (to install packages from official repositories)
Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Dependencies
------------

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: all
      roles:
         - role: practice
    ansible-playbook -i inventories/inventory site.yml --private-key ~rmontagnana/.ssh/id_rsa
